        <h1>Turtle Hatcheries</h1>
        <p>Unlike sanctuaries, zoos, rescue, or rehabilitation facilities, turtle hatcheries are not those. 
            They should only be utilized or employed when there is a hazard to the natural nesting conditions,
             such as when there is significant poaching, erosion, flooding, or predation.</p>

        <h1>Introduction About Turtles</h1>
        <p>The term "turtle" is derived from the French words "turtle" and "tortoise."
            Since it is a common name, it can be used regardless of taxonomic classification. 
            It could be used to refer to the entire order throughout North America. In Britain, the word is only applied to sea turtles,
             not to freshwater terrapins or terrestrial tortoises. Non-marine turtles were historically referred to as tortoises in Australia,
              which lacks actual tortoises (family Testudinidae), but more lately the term "turtle" has been adopted to refer to the entire group.
              There are 360 species of turtles, including freshwater terrapins and land-dwelling tortoises, 
              both currently extant and recently  extinct.</p>

                <h3>How long do sea turtles live</h3>
                <p>They may live for 150 years or longer. Similar to whales, sharks, and other species, 
                    it can be challenging to estimate a turtle's exact age. After all, the researchers are typically not present 
                    when the animals are delivered. However, others have hypothesized that big turtles may be able to live for 400â€“500 years.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Turtle-col">
            <h3>What do turtles eat</h3>
            <p> Although they are omnivores as hatchlings, adults are referred regarded as herbivores.
                Their main food sources are algae, seaweed, and seagrasses. Greens can rip grasses and seaweed and can
                 scrape algae off of rocks with the help of their finely serrated (sawlike) beak.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Turtle-col">
            <h3>How big can turtles grow</h3>
            <p>The olive and Kemp's ridley sea turtles are the smallest species, with shells that only reach a length of 
                70 cm (just over 2 ft) and a weight of up to 100 lbs (45 kg). 
                The largest marine turtles are leatherbacks. Leatherbacks often weigh 300 to 500 kg (660 to 1,100 lbs) 
                and are 1.5 to 2 m (4-6 ft) long..</p>

            <h3>Turtle Behaviour</h3>
            <p>In the ocean, flatback turtles may float at the surface for hours while appearing to sleep or enjoy the sun.
                 Seabirds frequently perch on the flatbacks' backs.</p>

            <h3>Saving Sea Turtles</h3>
            <p>Few experiences compare to viewing a sea turtle up close, as divers and snorkelers around the world are aware.
                The giant reptiles glide through the water with otherworldly ease; the largest can reach lengths of six feet and weights
                 of three quarters of a ton.

            <h3>Habitats of sea Turtles</h3>
            <p>Most species' adults can be found in bays, estuaries, lagoons, and shallow coastal waters.
                Some even go out on the open ocean. Some species' juveniles can be found both at sea and in bays and estuaries.</p>
